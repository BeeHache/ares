From Star Trek to speculative worlds beyond, we bring curiosity, joy, and honesty to every conversation — even when we don\'t always agree.

Named 2025 Best All-Around Star Trek Podcast by TrekMovie, the SyFy Sistas Podcast dives into TV, movies, books, comics, and conventions through the lens of lifelong fans who know that fandom is richer when more voices are heard. While Star Trek is our home base, our conversations also explore other genre favorites like Foundation, For All Mankind, The Expanse, Supacell, and films like Sinners — because great sci-fi doesn\'t exist in a vacuum.

Expect interviews with creators and talent, thoughtful debates, and lively discussions about the stories we love (and sometimes argue about). Our conversations are passionate but never gatekeepy, informed but never dry, and always rooted in the belief that Black voices belong at the center of fandom — not on the sidelines.

Whether you\'re a deep-cut Trekkie, a genre-hopper, or just looking for smart, joyful conversation, there\'s a seat for you at this table.

But when Trump came into office, everything changed. During the four years of the Trump presidency, Professor Joh would check Twitter five minutes before each class to find out what the 45th President had said and how it jibes with 200 years of the judicial branch interpreting and ruling on the Constitution. Acclaimed podcaster Roman Mars (99% Invisible) was so anxious about all the norms and laws being tested in the Trump era that he asked his neighbor, Elizabeth, to explain what was going on in the world from a Constitutional law perspective. Even after Trump left office, there is still so much for Roman to learn. What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law is a weekly, fun, casual Con Law 101 class that uses the tumultuous activities of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to teach us all about the US Constitution.
